# Nuxt Blog System

## Notes
*Spa Mode:* If, for any reason, you prefer not to use server side rendering or need static hosting for your applications, you can simply use SPA mode using nuxt --spa. In combination with the generate feature, it gives you a powerful SPA deployment mechanism without the need to use a Node.js runtime or any special server handling.
